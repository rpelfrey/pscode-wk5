// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if Number is Even or Odd

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("The number is even")

elif number % 2 == 1:
  print("The number is odd")

//Exercise 3: Write pseudocode that will perform the following.
 	a) Read in 5 separate numbers
	b) Calculate the average of the five numbers
	c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
	d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are.
List = a + b + c + d + e = f
List = 2,4,6,8,10
Num1 + Num2 + Num3 + Num4 + Num5 = sum 
Print sum 

ask for 5 numbers 
add the 5 numbers together
print on the screen the sum of the 5 numbers

sum / 5 = average

find minimum value in list

List = 2,4,6,8,10
Minimum value <=2
Maximum value >=10
Print min value
Print max value 


list = [2,4,6,8,10]
sum = 2+4+6+8+10
print(sum)
average = sum/5
print(average)



list = [2,4,6,8,10]
def find_min(list):  
  min_val = list[0]
  for i in range(1, len(list)):
    if list [i] < min_val:
      min_val = list[i]
  return min_val
list = [2,4,6,8,10]
print("Minimun value of this list is", find_min (list))
def find_max(list):
  max_val = list[0]
  for i in range(1, len(list)):
    if list [i] > max_val:
      max_val = list[i]
  return max_val
list = [2,4,6,8,10]
print("Maxiumum value of this list is", find_max (list))	

The average of the 5 numbers is 6.0. The minimum number in the list is 2 and the largest number in the list is 10.
